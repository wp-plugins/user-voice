User Voice is a WordPress plugin that makes it easy to incorporate the User Voice customer feedback system on your posts and pages without editing templates.

== Description ==

UserVoice is a Customer Feedback system that makes it easy for your users to report bugs and vote on new features. From their website:

"UserVoice allows your customers to vote on feedback and ideas submitted in the customer community. There is a limit on the number of votes a user can spend at any given time. When a customer creates an account, they are given 10 votes they can use as they see fit."

Normally, JavaScript code has to be inserted on each page where you want UserVoice to be used. That approach requires editing of templates and including conditionals based on post ID.

This plugin makes it easy to incorporate the User Voice customer feedback system on your posts and pages *without* editing templates.
